#### By _**James Donlan**_

## Description

_This program uses the Better Doctor API to find doctors in the Portland area, searching by name or by the condition you're looking to have treated._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repo from github_
* _use a terminal to navigate to the folder location_

* _Or use npm run dev to start the development server, which will open in a browser automatically and functions about the same_

## Known bugs

* _Currently insists I'm querying the API in the wrong format no matter how I try to structure it. Until I can search for a name and at least pull that name back out of the results I'm not sure how I'm going to get it to do anything else._

## Technologies Used
